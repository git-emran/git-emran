# 0‚Üí1 Engineer & Designer

I am passionate about programming and design and Vim. Why? I am an artist by nature, and for some reason any form of abstraction always attracts me. How do I "enjoy" programming and design ? Well I try to create all the things I can imagine. I enjoy the process first then the fruits of my labor.
